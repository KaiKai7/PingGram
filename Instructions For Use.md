# Instructions For Use

PingGram can be used on its own with any http web request you may already have, including Telegram.

Enter an ip address to ping, then press the "Ping IP Address" button. A toast will show the ping results unless the target is unreachable or the ping exceeds 2 seconds.

If the ping does not show a toast, then check the ip address formatting for empty spaces or other characters, then try again.

Web requests are sent when the ping time exceeds 2 seconds or the ping is unreachable, but only if the "start/stop" checkbox is checked to start scheduling.
