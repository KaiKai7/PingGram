# PingGram Instructions For Use

PingGram can be used on its own with any http web request you may already have, including Telegram.

Enter an ip address to ping, then press the "Ping IP Address" button. A toast will show the ping results unless the target is unreachable or the ping exceeds 2 seconds.

If the ping does not show a toast, then check the ip address formatting for empty spaces or other characters, then try again.

Web requests are sent when the ping time exceeds 2 seconds or the ping is unreachable, but only if the "start/stop" checkbox is checked to start scheduling.

Enter your web request in the "Enter URL" field, then check the checkbox to start the scheduled pings.

### TeleFormer
I have also created the TeleFormer app, TeleFormer can automatically format the Telegram web request URL. Spaces and new lines require special formatting and can be a pain to form, but just type your message and TeleFormer with format the web request. Format message spaces,new lines and even optionally append a silent attribute with a click to the Telegram web request URL.
You type the message you want and TeleFormer will format it.
Emoji's are accepted and can be used.

## Android Restrictions

Running apps in the background are subject to Android policies and future code updates may break that functionality, so this app has been coded to run with the screen open to avoid any future issues.

Of course, running with the screen open does present new issues. One of which is that Android will only allow the screen to stay open for 30 minutes before closing. Another way to keep the screen open, is the "Stay awake" toggle in Developer Options. This allows the phone screen to stay open when charging. Charging is something that should be done if the screen is open and the ping is running every 30 seconds anyway.

But if you have not already been to Developer Options, you will first have t perform the Google "Open Sesame" command and enable the option. To do this follow these steps, and it is really not that hard at all to do.
### Developer Options
* Go to Setttings
* Select "About phone"
* Scroll down to "Build number" and tap "Build number" seven times. And then you should see a toast saying unlocked or something similiar.
* Then go back one screen to "Settings".
* Select "System"
* Scroll down to "Developer options", nice !
* Scroll to "Stay awake" and toggle

Now that you performed the Google "Open Sesame" and have Developer Options, you dont have to do that again to expose it. So if you choose to turn off the stay awake feature, it is easy.

### Screen Brightness
That leaves the screen brightness, you may want to turn this down when the app is running especially at night. On current versions of Android, just swipe down from the top of the screen to expose the slider for the brightness.

There are shortcuts to change these settings directly, but different operating system versions introduce different methods and shortcuts. And covering all versions would be a task in itself.
